  Loss Aversion: we hate losses more than we love winning. 
Course 2: Compensation
    1) What are different forms of compensation?
        A: Base pay, relocation/signing bonus, annual bonus, equity compensation, financial benefits, and perks.
    2) What is equity?
        A: Value of a share of ownership of the business. Company ownership is divided into shares, and those shares entitle owners to                various rights. 
    3) How does holding shares of a private company differ from a public company?
        A: There is future financing, aka dilution. Your share of the company will decrease as the company issues more shares. 
    4) What are two common forms of equity compensation?
        A: stock options and restricted stock.
    5) What are stock options?
        A: Stock options are a "derivative", a security based on another security. 
    6) Are there possible consequences for owning stock options?
        A: There are tax consequences if the strike price (fair market value the day the options are granted)does not match the current             fair value, and when you exercise them.
    7) What does it mean to vest your stock options?
        A:  vesting period is the period of time before shares in an employee stock option plan or benefits in a retirement plan are                    unconditionally owned by an employee. If that person's employment terminates before the end of the vesting period, the                    company can buy back the shares at the original price.
    8) What is the benefit to vesting your stock options?
        A: There are tax consequences when you exercise a stock option based on type (ISO vs. NQSO), but not when you vest them. 
    9) What is restricted stock?
        A: Restricted stock is a broad term for shares in a company that have restriction on their ownership (example: vesting). 
    10) What happens immediately when you vest restricted stocks?
        A: You owe income taxes immediately when you vest restricted stock. Most companies withhold taxes by selling the portion of               stock necessary at that time. 
    11) Review: Pros and Cons of Stock Options vs restricted Stock:
        A: Stock options can be worthless if the value of the stock drops below the exercise price. Restricted stock only becomes
          worthless if the stock price drops to zero. Significant tax benefits with stock options, because you do not owe taxes upon                vesting & you can control when you exercise.
